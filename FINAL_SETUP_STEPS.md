# 🚀 Final Setup Steps - Complete Your Automation

Your automated deployment system is **99% complete**! Just follow these final steps to activate everything.

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Main app deployment configuration fixed (citizenly.co shows Next.js app)
- ✅ Storybook deployment workflow created and configured
- ✅ Git workflow automation with all scripts ready
- ✅ Project IDs and organization details identified
- ✅ All configuration files prepared

## 🔧 Final Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Vercel Token

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/account/tokens**
2. Click **"Create Token"**
3. Name: `GitHub Actions - Citizenly`
4. Scope: `Full Account`
5. Click **"Create Token"**
6. **Copy the token** (starts with `vercel_`)

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: **https://github.com/jasperlepardo/citizenly/settings/secrets/actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add these **3 secrets**:

```
Name: VERCEL_TOKEN
Value: XXrGzbbzGDtux0zX4aAPLbeC

Name: VERCEL_ORG_ID
Value: team_ECQY2ysqMz8q0PWlhjmjOzEo

Name: VERCEL_STORYBOOK_PROJECT_ID
Value: prj_bYx8cnaZ3hxpvN6DKFnv48u38vmW
```

### Step 3: Test the Automation

```bash
# Test the Storybook deployment
gh workflow run deploy-storybook.yml

# Or trigger via component change
echo "// Automation test" >> src/components/atoms/Button.tsx
git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger automated deployment" && git push
```

## 🎯 What Happens Next

Once you add those 3 secrets:

### Automatic Deployments ✨

- **Main App**: https://www.citizenly.co (already working!)
- **Storybook**: Auto-deploys when components change
- **PR Previews**: Storybook preview links in PR comments

### Available Commands 🛠️

```bash
# Git Workflow
npm run new-feature <name> "<desc>"    # Create feature branch
npm run commit <type> "<desc>"         # Smart conventional commit
npm run create-pr                      # Create GitHub PR
npm run complete-flow <name> "<desc>"  # Full workflow automation

# Deployment
npm run deploy:status    # Check deployment status
npm run deploy:test      # Test configurations
npm run deploy:storybook # Manual Storybook deploy
```

### Workflow Triggers 🔄

Storybook automatically deploys when you change:

- Components (`src/components/**`)
- Stories (`src/stories/**`)
- Storybook config (`.storybook/**`)
- Dependencies (`package.json`)

## 🎉 Success Verification

After adding secrets, check these URLs:

- ✅ **Main App**: https://www.citizenly.co
- ✅ **Storybook**: https://storybook-static-jasper-lepardos-projects.vercel.app
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/jasperlepardo/citizenly/actions

## 💡 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check automation status
npm run git-status
npm run deploy:status

# Complete workflow for new feature
npm run complete-flow my-feature "Add awesome feature"

# Manual deployments if needed
npm run deploy:storybook
vercel --prod  # Main app
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

If anything doesn't work:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/jasperlepardo/citizenly/actions
2. Verify all 3 secrets are set correctly
3. Test local builds: `npm run build` and `npm run build-storybook`

**You're just 3 secrets away from complete automation!** 🚀

The hard work is done - your entire CI/CD pipeline, Git workflow automation, and deployment system are ready to activate.
