## 🗺️ **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: MVP Implementation** *(Current Priority)*
```
Timeline: 4-6 weeks
Cost: $0/month hosting
Coverage: 95% of core functionality

Week 1: Database setup and deployment
Week 2-3: Frontend development (Next.js + components)
Week 4: Testing, optimization, and user training
```

### **Phase 2: User Validation** *(Month 2)*
```
Timeline: 4 weeks
Focus: Real-world usage and feedback

- Deploy to staging with real users
- Collect feedback and usage patterns
- Identify missing features or pain points
- Plan Phase 3 based on findings
```

### **Phase 3: Enhancement Decision** *(Month 3+)*
```
Decision Point: MVP sufficient vs Full features needed

Option A: Continue with MVP (most likely)
- Add polish and minor enhancements
- Optimize performance and user experience
- Scale within free tier limits

Option B: Upgrade to Full Features (if needed)
- Follow migration documentation
- 2-4 weeks migration timeline
- $25+/month hosting cost increase
```
