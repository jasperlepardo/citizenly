## 🔄 Phase 3: Integration & Testing [PLANNED]

### API Routes (Currently Using Supabase Direct)

**Current Implementation:**

- Using Supabase client-side queries for all data operations
- Real-time subscriptions working
- RLS policies handling security

**Future API Routes (Optional Enhancement):**

```typescript
// Future server-side endpoints for advanced features
POST   /api/residents          // Server-side validation
GET    /api/residents/export   // Data export
POST   /api/households/bulk    // Bulk operations
GET    /api/analytics          // Complex analytics
```

### State Management (Not Started)

```typescript
// Zustand stores needed
-useAuthStore - // User authentication state
  useResidentStore - // Resident data and operations
  useHouseholdStore - // Household management
  useUIStore; // UI state (modals, notifications)
```

### Testing Strategy (Not Started)

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
