# RBI System - Next Steps

## Actionable Tasks for Immediate Development

**Generated**: December 2024  
**Priority**: MVP Launch

## üéØ Current Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

### Priority 1: Complete Resident Registration

**Why**: Core functionality needed for MVP

#### Tasks:

```typescript
// 1. Create multi-step form component
src/components/modules/residents/RegistrationWizard.tsx
- Step 1: Personal Information

- Step 3: Employment & Education
- Step 4: Sectoral Information
- Step 5: Review & Submit

// 2. Add validation schemas
src/lib/validations/resident.ts
- Personal info validation
- Address validation
- Employment validation
- Sectoral calculation logic

// 3. Implement API endpoint
src/app/api/residents/route.ts
- POST handler for creation
- Validation middleware
- Error handling
```

#### Commands:

```bash
# Create the files
touch src/components/modules/residents/RegistrationWizard.tsx
touch src/lib/validations/resident.ts
touch src/app/api/residents/route.ts

# Test the implementation
npm run dev
# Navigate to /residents/new
```

## üìù Development Checklist

### Before Starting Each Task:

- [ ] Pull latest from develop branch
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Review existing code patterns
- [ ] Check component library for reusable parts

### While Developing:

- [ ] Write TypeScript interfaces first
- [ ] Use existing UI components
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport

### Before Committing:

- [ ] Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Run `npm run test`
- [ ] Write meaningful commit message
- [ ] Update relevant documentation

## üö´ What NOT to Do (Save for Later)

### Don't Implement Yet:

- Advanced reporting features
- Data import/export
- Mobile app
- Complex analytics
- Multi-barangay support
- Email notifications
- SMS integration
- Offline mode

### Don't Over-Engineer:

- Keep forms simple initially
- Use basic tables (no virtualization yet)
- Simple client-side search first
- Basic error messages
- Standard loading spinners

## üéÆ Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run lint            # Check code style
npm run typecheck       # Check TypeScript
npm run test            # Run tests

# Database
npm run db:push         # Push schema changes
npm run db:seed         # Seed test data
npm run db:reset        # Reset database

# Deployment
git push origin feature/xxx  # Push feature branch
# Create PR on GitHub
# Auto-deploy to Vercel on merge
```

---

## üî• If You Get Stuck

### Common Issues:

#### "Type error in component"

```bash
# Check the type definition
npm run typecheck

# Look at similar components
ls src/components/modules/
```

#### "Supabase connection failed"

```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env.local

# Test connection
npx supabase status
```

#### "Build failing"

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

#### "Tests failing"

```bash
# Run specific test
npm test -- ResidentForm

# Update snapshots if needed
npm test -- -u
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use existing components** - Check component library first
2. **Follow patterns** - Look at similar code in the project
3. **Test early** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Ask questions** - Unclear requirements? Ask!
5. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
6. **Document weird stuff** - Add comments for complex logic
