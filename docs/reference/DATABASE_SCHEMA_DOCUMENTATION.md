```sql
CHECK (
    (birth_place_code IS NULL AND birth_place_level IS NULL) OR
    (birth_place_code IS NOT NULL AND birth_place_level IS NOT NULL)
)
```

**Constraint Design:**
- **All-or-Nothing Approach:** Prevents partial birth place data
- **Level Requirement:** PSGC code must include hierarchy level (region=1, province=2, city=3, barangay=4)
- **Migration Analysis:** Complete data enables accurate origin-destination flow analysis

**Note:** Full PSGC code validation (format, existence, level consistency) is handled by database triggers due to constraint complexity limitations.

### **14.5 Identity Document Constraints**
