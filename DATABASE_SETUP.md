# Database Setup for Profile Creation Fix

The signup process was failing because the database tables and permissions weren't properly configured. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Step 1: Run Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `/src/lib/database-setup.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will:
- ✅ Add missing columns to `user_profiles` table (`mobile_number`, `barangay_code`, `status`)
- ✅ Create the `barangay_accounts` table if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Set up proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Create necessary indexes and triggers

## Step 2: Test Signup

After running the database setup:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Fill out the registration form
3. The signup should now work properly

## What Was Fixed

### Issues Found:
1. **Missing columns**: `mobile_number`, `barangay_code`, `status` didn't exist in `user_profiles`
2. **Missing table**: `barangay_accounts` table didn't exist
3. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security was blocking profile creation

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Database Schema**: Added all required columns safely using conditional SQL
2. **RLS Policies**: Updated to allow users to create their own profiles during signup
3. **Error Handling**: Improved signup form to show detailed error messages
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Process continues even if optional tables don't exist

## Verification

After setup, you should see:
- ✅ Successful user account creation
- ✅ Profile data saved to database
- ✅ Barangay assignment (if table exists)
- ✅ Email verification workflow

The error "Account created but profile setup failed" should no longer occur.
