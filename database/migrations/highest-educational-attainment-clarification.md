# Highest Educational Attainment Field Update

## ‚úÖ **Field Renamed for Clarity**

**Changed**: `education_level` ‚Üí `highest_educational_attainment`

## üéØ **Clear Distinction**

### Field Purposes:
1. **`highest_educational_attainment`** - Highest level of education **completed/attained**
2. **`education_status`** - Current education participation status

## üìä **Field Definitions**

### Highest Educational Attainment (`education_level_enum`):
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `'elementary'` | Completed elementary/primary school |
| `'high_school'` | Completed secondary/high school |
| `'college'` | Completed college/university degree |
| `'post_graduate'` | Completed post-graduate/masters/doctorate |
| `'vocational'` | Completed vocational/technical course |

### Education Status (`education_status_enum`):
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `'currently_studying'` | Currently enrolled in school |
| `'not_studying'` | Not currently enrolled |
| `'graduated'` | Recently completed education level |
| `'dropped_out'` | Left school without completing |

## üéØ **Real-World Examples**

### Example 1: College Student
```sql
highest_educational_attainment = 'high_school'  -- Completed high school
education_status = 'currently_studying'         -- Now studying in college
```

### Example 2: High School Graduate Not Continuing
```sql
highest_educational_attainment = 'high_school'  -- Completed high school
education_status = 'not_studying'               -- Not pursuing further education
```

### Example 3: College Graduate
```sql
highest_educational_attainment = 'college'      -- Completed college degree
education_status = 'graduated'                  -- Recently graduated
```

### Example 4: High School Dropout
```sql
highest_educational_attainment = 'elementary'   -- Only completed elementary
education_status = 'dropped_out'                -- Left high school incomplete
```

### Example 5: Working Professional
```sql
highest_educational_attainment = 'college'      -- Completed college degree
education_status = 'not_studying'               -- Not currently in school (working)
```

## üîç **OSY Logic Impact**

The OSY calculation now clearly uses **highest attainment** for determining eligibility:

```sql
-- OSY: Ages 15-24 without college/post-graduate attainment
AND highest_educational_attainment NOT IN ('college', 'post_graduate')
```

**Meaning**: If someone has **already completed** college or post-graduate studies, they are **never OSY** regardless of current education status.

## üìã **Updated OSY Examples**

### ‚úÖ **OSY = TRUE**:
1. **19-year-old, high school attainment, not studying, unemployed**
   - Has only completed high school, currently not in education or employment

2. **22-year-old, vocational attainment, dropped out of college, no job**
   - Highest completion is vocational, didn't finish college attempt

### ‚ùå **OSY = FALSE**:
1. **20-year-old, college attainment, not studying, unemployed**
   - Has completed college degree (excluded from OSY)

2. **18-year-old, high school attainment, currently studying in college**
   - Currently enrolled in education

## üéØ **Benefits of This Clarity**

1. **Precise Classification**: Clear distinction between what's completed vs. current status
2. **Accurate OSY Calculation**: Based on actual educational achievement
3. **Better Data Quality**: Avoids confusion between current and completed education
4. **Policy Compliance**: Aligns with official definitions of educational attainment
5. **Reporting Accuracy**: Statistics reflect true educational achievement levels

The field name now clearly indicates it tracks the **highest level of education actually completed** by the resident!
