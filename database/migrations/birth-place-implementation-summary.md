# Birth Place Implementation - Single Field Approach (PSOC-style)

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The birth place functionality has been successfully implemented using a single field approach, similar to how PSOC (Philippine Standard Occupational Classification) is handled in the system.

## üéØ User Request Fulfilled

**Original Request**: *"can we implement similar to psoc where it will only be a single field"*

**Solution Implemented**: Single field approach with `birth_place_code` + `birth_place_level` (exactly like `psoc_code` + `psoc_level`)

## üìä Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Fields Added
- `birth_place_code VARCHAR(10)` - Stores PSGC code at any level
- `birth_place_level birth_place_level_enum` - Specifies which PSGC level (region, province, city_municipality, barangay)
- `birth_place_text VARCHAR(200)` - Free text fallback for foreign countries
- `birth_place_full TEXT GENERATED` - Auto-calculated complete address

### 2. Enum Created
```sql
CREATE TYPE birth_place_level_enum AS ENUM (
    'region', 'province', 'city_municipality', 'barangay'
);
```

### 3. Auto-Calculated Address Generation
The `birth_place_full` column automatically generates complete addresses:
- **Barangay level**: "Barangay Name, City Name, Province Name, Region Name"
- **City level**: "City Name, Province Name, Region Name"
- **Province level**: "Province Name, Region Name"
- **Region level**: "Region Name"
- **Free text**: Shows text as-is (for foreign countries)

### 4. Data Validation
- Constraint ensures `birth_place_code` exists in appropriate PSGC table
- Validates code matches the specified level

## üîç Search and Selection Features

### 1. Birth Place Options View
```sql
SELECT * FROM birth_place_options 
WHERE place_level = 'province';
```

### 2. Search Function (Like PSOC)
```sql
-- Find all places with "Manila" in the name
SELECT * FROM search_birth_places('Manila');

-- Find provinces containing "Bataan"
SELECT * FROM search_birth_places('Bataan', 'province'::birth_place_level_enum);
```

### 3. Detailed Lookup
```sql
-- Get full details for a specific code/level
SELECT * FROM get_birth_place_details('01', 'region'::birth_place_level_enum);
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Resident Born in Specific Barangay
```sql
INSERT INTO residents (..., birth_place_code, birth_place_level, ...)
VALUES (..., '042604001', 'barangay', ...);
-- Result: birth_place_full = "Barangay Name, City Name, Province Name, Region Name"
```

### Example 2: Resident Born in Province (Unknown City)
```sql
INSERT INTO residents (..., birth_place_code, birth_place_level, ...)
VALUES (..., '0426', 'province', ...);
-- Result: birth_place_full = "Bataan, Region III (Central Luzon)"
```

### Example 3: Resident Born Abroad
```sql
INSERT INTO residents (..., birth_place_text, ...)
VALUES (..., 'New York, USA', ...);
-- Result: birth_place_full = "New York, USA"
```

## üéØ Benefits of Single Field Approach

1. **Consistent with PSOC**: Same pattern as occupation classification
2. **Flexible Granularity**: Users can select any level (region to barangay)
3. **Storage Efficient**: Single code instead of 4 separate fields
4. **Easy Validation**: One constraint handles all levels
5. **Simple Queries**: One field to filter/search on
6. **Auto-Complete Friendly**: Hierarchical selection like PSOC dropdowns

## üîß Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- Use `birth_place_options` view to populate dropdowns
- Implement cascading selection (region ‚Üí province ‚Üí city ‚Üí barangay)
- Use `search_birth_places()` for autocomplete functionality

### Reporting Integration
- `birth_place_full` provides ready-to-display addresses
- Filter by level for geographic analytics
- Full-text search enabled on generated address

## ‚ú® Auto-Calculated Features

1. **Age Calculation**: `age INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(birthdate))) STORED`
2. **Address Generation**: `birth_place_full` automatically builds complete address
3. **Search Optimization**: Full-text search index on generated address

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Validation

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Data validation constraints ensure PSGC code validity
- Proper foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- Audit trails track all changes
