# Graduate/Under Graduate Education System

## ✅ **Simplified 2-Status System Implemented**

The education system now uses a **simple binary approach**:

### 📊 **Education Status Values:**
- `'graduate'` - **Completed** the education level
- `'under_graduate'` - **Still studying** or **did not complete** the level

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Education Attainment + Status Combinations:**

| Education Attainment | Status | Real-World Meaning |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------|
| `elementary` | `graduate` | Completed elementary school |
| `elementary` | `under_graduate` | Did not finish elementary (rare) |
| `high_school` | `graduate` | Completed high school |
| `high_school` | `under_graduate` | Still in high school OR dropped out |
| `college` | `graduate` | **Completed college degree** |
| `college` | `under_graduate` | **Still studying college** |
| `post_graduate` | `graduate` | Completed masters/doctorate |
| `post_graduate` | `under_graduate` | Still studying masters/doctorate |
| `vocational` | `graduate` | Completed vocational course |
| `vocational` | `under_graduate` | Still in vocational training |

## 🎯 **Real Examples:**

### **College Student (Junior Year):**
```sql
education_attainment = 'college'
education_status = 'under_graduate'  -- Still studying college
```
**Meaning**: "I'm working towards a college degree but haven't finished yet"

### **High School Graduate (Not in College):**
```sql
education_attainment = 'high_school'
education_status = 'graduate'  -- Completed high school
```
**Meaning**: "I finished high school and am not currently studying"

### **College Graduate (Working):**
```sql
education_attainment = 'college'
education_status = 'graduate'  -- Completed college
```
**Meaning**: "I have a college degree"

### **High School Dropout:**
```sql
education_attainment = 'elementary'  -- Highest completed level
education_status = 'graduate'  -- Did complete elementary
```
**Meaning**: "I completed elementary but didn't finish high school"

## 🎯 **OSC Logic (Ages 6-14):**

```sql
-- OSC if under_graduate status for elementary/high school age appropriate education
is_out_of_school_children = (
    education_status = 'under_graduate' 
    AND education_attainment IN ('elementary', 'high_school')
)
```

**OSC Examples:**
- 8-year-old: `elementary` + `under_graduate` → **OSC** (should be studying elementary)
- 12-year-old: `high_school` + `under_graduate` → **OSC** (should be studying high school)
- 10-year-old: `elementary` + `graduate` → **Not OSC** (completed elementary)

## 🎯 **OSY Logic (Ages 15-24):**

```sql
-- OSY if haven't completed college OR still studying college, and status is under_graduate
is_out_of_school_youth = (
    (education_attainment NOT IN ('college', 'post_graduate') OR 
     (education_attainment IN ('college', 'post_graduate') AND education_status = 'under_graduate'))
    AND education_status = 'under_graduate'
    AND not employed
)
```

**OSY Examples:**

### ✅ **OSY = TRUE:**
1. **18-year-old high school graduate not in college:**
   - `high_school` + `graduate` + unemployed → **OSY**

2. **20-year-old college dropout:**
   - `high_school` + `graduate` + unemployed → **OSY**

3. **22-year-old still in college but not studying:**
   - `college` + `under_graduate` + unemployed → **OSY**

### ❌ **OSY = FALSE:**
1. **21-year-old college graduate:**
   - `college` + `graduate` → **Not OSY** (completed college)

2. **19-year-old working:**
   - `high_school` + `graduate` + employed → **Not OSY** (employed)

## 🎯 **Benefits of This System:**

### ✅ **For Users:**
- **Simpler Choice**: Only 2 options instead of 4
- **Clearer Logic**: "Did you finish this level or not?"
- **Intuitive**: Matches how people think about education

### ✅ **For System:**
- **Cleaner Logic**: Binary classification
- **Easier Validation**: Simple true/false for completion
- **Better Analytics**: Clear graduate vs non-graduate statistics

### ✅ **For OSC/OSY:**
- **More Accurate**: Directly checks completion status
- **Simplified Rules**: Easier to understand and maintain
- **Flexible**: Handles various real-world scenarios

## 📋 **Data Entry Examples:**

### Form Logic:
```
Education Level: [Dropdown: Elementary, High School, College, Post Graduate, Vocational]
Status: 
○ Graduate (I completed this level)
○ Under Graduate (I didn't complete this level OR still studying)
```

This system is **much more intuitive** and provides **clearer data** for government reporting and OSC/OSY classification!
