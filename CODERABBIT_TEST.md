# CodeRabbit Setup Test

This file is created to test CodeRabbit integration with the citizenly repository.

## What CodeRabbit will review:

✅ **TypeScript type safety** - Our main focus  
✅ **Security issues** - Critical for production  
✅ **Performance optimizations** - Database and React  
✅ **Code maintainability** - Long-term quality  
✅ **Best practices** - Framework-specific patterns  

## Configuration highlights:

- Focus on production-critical files (API routes, types, hooks)
- Skip test files and documentation to reduce noise
- Medium+ severity only to avoid over-notification
- Custom rules for Supabase error handling
- TypeScript `any` type detection (our recent fix)

**Status:** Testing CodeRabbit integration
